# VAP 3.5
The MATLAB version of the higher-order potential flow code FreeWake.

This markdown file holds information and records of VAP 3, development of a new input format for future versions of VAP. Similar to previous input files, parameters of the flight vehicle geometry are stored in ASCII text file but in XML 1.0 language. This will provide freedom for future versions of VAP and enable analysis of complex vehicle geometry and configuration.

## Notes
### Default Unit
All numerical input would have a default unit assigned. (e.g. meters for the reference span). This can be setup with a `unit` tag under the numerical parameter such that specific units can be converted to the default unit in ***future*** VAP releases.

For example:
`<span unit='feet'>5</span>` 

would yield the same result as
`<span>1.524</span>`
